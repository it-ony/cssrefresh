# cssrefresh

CSSrefresh is a small javascript library that monitors the CSS-files included in your 
webpage. Within 1 second after changing an included css file the style changes are 
applied to the webpage without reloading the browser.

This project is inspired by 
[http://cssrefresh.frebsite.nl/](http://cssrefresh.frebsite.nl/), but rewritten from
scratch as I couldn't find any github repository or twitter profile to communicate the 
issue that made it not working for me anymore.
 
Usage
--

```html
<body>
    <script async src="https://it-ony.github.io/cssrefresh/cssrefresh.js"></script>
</body>
```

or visit [https://it-ony.github.io/cssrefresh](https://it-ony.github.io/cssrefresh) and
drag the bookmarklet to your bookmark bar.
